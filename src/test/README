This directory contains a test suite for CLiCC and an example of the FFI
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile the file testmain.lisp with CLiCC, run the command
../../bin/cl testmain and execute the resulting file testmain.

When you type 'a', every test will be run and its result will be
checked against the expected result. 
If everything works fine, you should get only a messages about
two failed tests:
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Failed tests: 
;;;   Binding  6 (uses ANSI CL's declaration scope)
;;;   Binding 13 (uses ANSI CL's declaration scope)
;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is ok, because CLiCC currently implements the declaration scope
rules of CLtL1 and these tests expect the declaration scope rules of
CLtL2. 

In the file time.lisp you will find an implementation of the TIME
macro wich is not supported by CLiCC, because it is considered to be
part of a CL development environment. time.lisp uses the foreign
function interface of CLiCC to call the UNIX times function. This
function and some related types are defined in time.def.
You may compile the file boyer.lisp to see a working example of using
the foreign function interface.
